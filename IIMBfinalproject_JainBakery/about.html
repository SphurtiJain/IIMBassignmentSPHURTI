      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>What began as a simple hobby — baking for friends, family, and festive occasions — soon grew into something truly special.</p> <p>Jain Bakery was born out of a home kitchen, where every cake, cookie, and cupcake was crafted with care, love, and the promise of purity.</p>
      <p>As word spread and ovens kept baking, our little venture blossomed into a beloved part of the community.</p> <p>Today, Jain Bakery is more than just a bakery — it’s a part of local celebrations, everyday joys, and heartfelt moments.</p> <p>And while we’ve grown, one thing remains the same: our commitment to bringing you wholesome, homemade goodness that feels like it was baked just for you.</p>
