Everything ranging from ideation to product design and to the actual marketing of the product was implemented as a real life project. My idea was to monetize on my communication and public speaking skills for this project, using which I developed a simple tangible product with the aim of solving the problem of time management for students. Out of the budget of Rs250, I utilized Rs100 and achieved a revenue of Rs245, thereby generating a profit of 145%.</li>
